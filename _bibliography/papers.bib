  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein, A. and Podolsky, B. and Rosen, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},

  title={Cue-word Driven Neural Response Generation with a Shrinking Vocabulary},
  author={Wang, Qiansheng and Liu, Yuxin and Lv, Chengguo and Wang, Zhen and Fu, Guohong},
  journal={arXiv preprint arXiv:2010.04927},
  abstract={Open-domain response generation is the task of generating sensible and informative responses to the source sentence. However, neural models tend to generate safe and meaningless responses.  While cue-word introducing approaches encourage responses with concrete semantics and have shown tremendous potential, they still fail to explore diverse responses during decoding. In this paper, we propose a novel but natural approach that can produce multiple cue-words during decoding, and then uses the produced cue-words to drive decoding and shrinks the decoding vocabulary. Thus the neural generation model can explore the full space of responses and discover informative ones with efficiency. Experimental results show that our approach significantly outperforms several strong baseline models with much lower decoding complexity. Especially, our approach can converge to concrete semantics more efficiently during decoding.},

  abstract={Although stance detection has made great progress in the past few years, it is still facing the problem of unseen targets. In this study, we investigate the domain difference between targets and thus incorporate attention-based conditional encoding with adversarial domain generalization to perform unseen target stance detection. Experimental results show that our approach achieves new state-of-the-art performance on the SemEval-2016 dataset, demonstrating the importance of domain difference between targets in unseen target stance detection.},

  abstract={The authors propose a neural network library N3LDG for natural language processing. N3LDG constructs computation graphs dynamically, and then executes the computation graphs using dynamic batching. Experiments show that N3LDG can efficiently construct and execute computation graphs when training various neural networks (i.e., CNN, Bi-LSTM, and Tree-LSTM). Moreover, N3LDG achieves better training speed than PyTorch on both the CPU and GPU.},
