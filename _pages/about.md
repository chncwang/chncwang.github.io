I'm a programmer mainly interested in A.I., especially NLP and A.I. system.

Long before I get interested in A.I., I got my favorite hobby, which is the game of Go. The rule of Go is extremely simple, but it leads to the most complicated game states, which is really fascinating.

In the year 2011, I developed a Go A.I. using MCTS (Monte Carlo tree search) when I was doing my undergraduate thesis. And one year later, I rewrote the program on a Github [repo](http://github.com/chncwang/foolgo) and named it as *FoolGo*. The Go A.I. was an unpopular topic ten years ago, and I had never expected that FoolGo would gain hundreds of stars around the game of AlphaGo vs. Lee Sedol.

Surprised by the fact that MCTS with neural networks can master the game of Go, I quit my job as a Java developer and went back to college to study A.I..
